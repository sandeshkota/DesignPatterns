Design Patterns are general, reusable solutions to commonn problems in Software Desing. 
Each Pattern is like a blue print which can(should) be customized based on the need to solve a problem in your code.
<br />
Pattern is not a code that you can refer in your project. It is more of a concept which should be customized based on the need and adopted in your project.


## History
Patterns as a concept gained popularity after the book **Design Patterns: Elements of reusable Object Oriented Software** 
was published in 1994 by four authors who are famously called as **Gang Of Four**
